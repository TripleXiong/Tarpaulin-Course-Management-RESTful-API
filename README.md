Tarpaulin, a lightweight course management tool that’s an “alternative” to Canvas.  In particular, Tarpaulin allows users (instructors and students) to see information about the courses they’re teaching/taking.  It allows instructors to create assignments for their courses, and it allows students to submit solutions to those assignments.
